Main Processing Stages
======================

Get the data
-read in text from file
-remove all punctuation
-convert to lowercase
-get all trigrams - 3 adjacent words split into key and value (2+1)
-store keys and values in collection

Use the data
-chose arbitrary starting point
-look up associated keys and pick value at random
-use end of key and value as next key
-repeat until no keys are found - or predetermined sentence length is met
-repeat process to generate lots of sentences
-repeat to generate specified sentences
-each sentence should start with capital and end with period
-write data to output file


STORE DATA
==========

- for each line in file
	- remove punctuation
	- convert to lowercase
	- count words and determine the number of trigrams
	- for number of trigrams
		- get key and value and store in map

Note that number of n-grams is wordcount - (nGramFactor -1)
This was determined by doing some simple calculation on varying wordcounts and factors and spotting patterns


GENERATE STORY
==============

- determine number of paragraphs to generate
- determine number of lines to generate
- determine number of words per line
- for each line in story
	- create empty line string
	- choose random key, capitalise first letter and add to line string
	- for number of words -1
		- for last key, choose random value from map and append to line string
		- generate next key using last word of last key and new value
	- add full stop to end of line line
	- write line string to output
